## TODO
- add nice spacing and typography for easy reading
- pdf options
  - problem numbers [true]
  - number of columns [auto]
  - font
  - include column labels
  - print
- addition
- subtraction
- mult? div?
- hex?

### Other Projects That Could Depend On This
- do the problems online/on computer
- a website to serve these up and let people use them for free
  - a web API that serves it, so people can do that programmatically
  - a snail mail service?
    - https://developers.lulu.com/price-calculator
  - if there's going to be exercises in the browser,
    - parseInt('0101', 2)
  - maybe re-implement in Javascript so all computation and rendering is done on the client
    - [PDF rendering in the browser](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/render-pdfs-in-the-browser-with-pdf-js/)
