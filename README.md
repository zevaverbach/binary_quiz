# Binary Math Exercises

## Description

A command line application and Python library for generating binary numbers for a human to decode, as well as generating the integers they represent, to check the human's work.

## Installation on MacOS or Linux
1) `git clone https://github.com/Averbach-Transcription/email_quote`
2) `ln -s <repo_fullpath>/app/get_quote /usr/local/bin/`
3) brew install ghostscript ([install homebrew](https://brew.sh) if needed)
4) brew install enscript

## Usage
```make_binary_problems <number_of_bits: integer> <number_of_problems: integer>```

## TODO
- add nice spacing for easy reading
- pdf options
  - problem numbers [true]
  - number of columns [auto]
  - font
  - include column labels
  - print

### Other Projects That Could Depend On This
- do the problems online/on computer
- a website to serve these up and let people use them for free
  - a web API that serves it, so people can do that programmatically
